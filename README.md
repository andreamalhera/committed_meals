# Committed Meals
This is a cookbook but also much more. :smile: I want to have the ultimate personal cookbook, where version control is not a fuzz. Using git grep functions all recipes can be searched by labels, ingredients, categories, preparation method and much more! (So excited right now...) But not only ingredients lists and instructions, I also want to add here my learnings about nutritional value from scientific papers and references, so we are all ready for any foodie argument. As well as veggie, or vegan (coming soon...) :tomato: :broccoli: :lemon:

## Pending: 
* TODO: Add ideas and research about nutritional value from e.g. Dr. Greg, Logi Methode, etc.
* TODO: Add cool layout, format for recipes
* TODO: Include beverages knowledge (Wine, old-fashioned, licuados)
* TODO: About veganizing good classic recipes without losing taste :wink: 
* TODO: Add section about how to keep ingredients fresh
* TODO: Where to put stories and anectotes?
* TODO: NLP to different languages
* TODO: Think if creating frontend and sepparating recipes makes sense
* TODO: Add chapter about seasonality
* TODO: Add info about how to storage fresh ingredients best
