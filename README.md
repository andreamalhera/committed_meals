# comitted_meals

# TODO ideas (because I have many): 
* Add ideas and research about nutritional value from e.g. Dr. Greg, Logi Methode, etc.
* Add cool layout, format for recipes
* Include beverages knowledge (Wine, old-fashioned, licuados)
* Where to put stories and anectotes?
* NLP to different languages
* Think if creating frontend and sepparating recipes makes sense
