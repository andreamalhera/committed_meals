# Committed Meals
This is a cookbook but also much more. :smile: I want to have the ultimate personal cookbook, where version control is not a fuzz. Using git grep functions all recipes can be searched by labels, ingredients, categories, preparation method and much more! (So excited right now...) But not only ingredients lists and instructions, I also want to add here my learnings about nutritional value from scientific papers and references, so we are all ready for any foodie argument. As well as veggie, or vegan (coming soon...) :tomato: :broccoli: :lemon:

# TODO ideas (because I have many): 
* Add ideas and research about nutritional value from e.g. Dr. Greg, Logi Methode, etc.
* Add cool layout, format for recipes
* Include beverages knowledge (Wine, old-fashioned, licuados)
* About veganizing good classic recipes without losing taste :wink: 
* Where to put stories and anectotes?
* NLP to different languages
* Think if creating frontend and sepparating recipes makes sense

## To create a new recipe

1.  Navigate to the recipes directory, and then the category where you
    want to add a recipe.
    
1.  Click the "new file" button at the top right: ![](images/file-buttons.png)

1.  In the "name your file..." box, ![](images/file-name.png), 
    type the name of the recipe. This should be:
    
    * brief
    * all in lower case
    * use `_` to separate words
    * end in `.md`

1.  Enter the recipe in the large edit box. Most recipes have three sections:
 
    ```
    # This is the title
    
    * Each ingredient is 
    * listed on
    * a line that starts with an asterisk
    
    The method is listed below.
    ```
    
    You can click preview to check that everything is formatted correctly.

1.  Write "Adding new recipe" in the (small) first box under 
    "commit changes". Leave the (large) second box blank.
  
1.  Click the "commit changes" button: ![](images/commit-button.png)

1.  The recipe will show up on <https://github.com/andreamalhera/committed_meals/tree/master/recipes> in a few minutes.
    Don't worry if something goes wrong, github keeps a copy of every change,
    so there's nothing you can do that can't be undone.
