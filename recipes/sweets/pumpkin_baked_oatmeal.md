# Pumpkin Baked Oatmeal

* 2 large eggs
* 3/4 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 3 tablespoons maple syrup / agave syrup
* 1/2 cup unsweetened oat milk
* 1.5 cups rolled oats
* 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour (OR all-purpose gluten free flour)
* 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* pinch of salt
* 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional)
* cinammon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves (pumpkin spice)

First, preheat oven to 180ºC and spray a 23x23 cm baking dish (we used a 20x28 cm, which has a similar surface area). Next, place dry ingredients into a large bowl and mix. Then, add wet ingredients and mix again. Transfer batter into baking dish and use a spatula to evenly spread it out. Sprinkle on more chocolate chips, if desired. Then, bake at 180ºC for around 25 minutes. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
