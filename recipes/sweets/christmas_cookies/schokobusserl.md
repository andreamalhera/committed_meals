# Schokobusserl
3 baking sheets, parchment paper necessary

* 250 g butter
* 250 g sugar
* 400 g ground hazelnuts
* 1 grated chocolate bar

Mix the butter until frothy and then with all other ingredients. Using moist hands shape little balls and put them on parchment paper on the baking sheet. Bake in circulating air at 130 °C for 30-35 min. Let them cool down, serve and enjoy!
