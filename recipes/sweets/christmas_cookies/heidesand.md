3 baking sheets, parchment paper necessary

* 250 g butter
* 250 g sugar
* 340 g flour

Lightly brown butter and let it cool down. Add all other ingredients. Using moist hands shape little balls and put them on parchment paper on the baking sheet. Bake in circulating air at 110 °C for 30 min. Let them cool down, serve and enjoy!
