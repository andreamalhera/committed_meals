# Cowpoke Cookies
approx. 25 big cookies, parchment paper necessary

* 1 1/3 cups oatmeal
* 2/3 cups flour 
* 2/3 ground hazelnut
* 8 g baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 50 g planed almonds
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 8 g vanilla sugar
* 2 eggs
* 150 g melted butter
* 1 cup chocolate lentils (e.g. M&Ms)

Mix all dry ingredients except chocolate lentils, add all other ingredients except chocolate lentils and mix them well. Form 2,5 cm diameter balls. Preheat oven to 150 Â°C. Place balls on the parchment paper keeping a 5 cm distance between each other and bake them for 8 min. Serve and enjoy.

For a present place all dry ingredients in layers in a jar. Cover with nice cloth and a sweet ribbon.
