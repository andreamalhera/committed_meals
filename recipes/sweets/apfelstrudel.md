# Apfelstrudel

* 1 pkg. frozen puff pastry
* 2 large apples, cored, quartered and sliced
* 6-8 dates, chopped
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* powdered sugar
* coconut oil

Preheat the oven to 190 Â°C fan. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Mix the apples with the cinnamon and dates. Pile the filling along the length of the pastry. Make slits in dough, and criss-cross cut slits over filling. Tuck the ends in and brush with coconut oil. Bake for 35 min or until golden-brown. Leave to cool to room temperature and dust with sugar powder.
