# Amazing Brownies
approx. 16 pieces (one baking sheet), parchment paper necessary

* 500 g kidney beans, cooked or canned (corresponds to the drained weight here)
* 100 g (gluten-free) oat flakes
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 pinch of salt
* 6 tbsp unsweetened chocolate powder
* 100 ml rice milk
* 1/2 teaspoon bourbon vanilla
* 50 ml liquid coconut oil
* 100 g apple puree or applesauce
* 5 tbsp liquid sweetener (e.g. agave or rice syrup, no sweetener!)
* 1 tbsp chia seeds or linseeds plus 3 tbsp water
* 50 g dark chocolate droplets / pieces (optional)
* 3 tbsp chopped nuts (e.g. walnuts) (optional)


Wash kidney beans very thoroughly until the liquid that drips off is clear to avoid excessive beans flavor.
Put the oatmeal in a blender and grind it finely.
Put the ground oat flakes, kidney beans, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, rice milk, vanilla, liquid coconut oil, apple pulp and liquid sweetener in a bowl and mix everything very well. If necessary, add more sweetness if the dough is not yet sweet enough for you.
Mix the chia seeds/linseeds with 3 tablespoons of water and let them swell briefly. Fold the chia gel, chocolate chips and chopped nuts into the batter.
Put the dough in a greased baking dish and bake the vegan brownies in a preheated oven at 175 degrees for 15 to 30 minutes. The individual baking time can vary and depends on the particular oven. Mine were perfect after 22 minutes. When you do the random test, the dough should still be slightly damp.
Before you cut the brownies into pieces, you should let them cool slightly. Let cool down completely to store and fill into a box. Seal vegan brownies airtight and store in the refrigerator.

The next day, these vegan brownies with kidney beans taste even better! ðŸ™‚
