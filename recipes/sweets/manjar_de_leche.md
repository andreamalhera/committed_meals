# Manjar de Leche
approx. 16 pieces (one baking sheet), parchment paper necessary

* 1 can condensed milk (Milchm√§dchen in Germany)
* 1 can evaporated condensed milk
* 400 ml milk
* 1 cinammon stick
* 5 egg yolks
* 8 tbsp. corn starch
* 1 pinch of salt
* raisins

To aromatize cook the cinnamon stick in milk. Mix both condensed milk, egg yolks and corn starch in a big bowl. Pour out cooking milk in the bowl and stir without a pause until it hardens. If it hardens too much, add milk. Sprinkle salt into bowl and serve in a glass bowl. Springle with raisins or other on top. Enjoy!

#### Pending: 
* TODO: Veganize: Find replacement for milks and eggs. (Maybe a whole other recipe)
