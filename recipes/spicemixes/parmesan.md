# Vegan parmesan cheese

* 1 cup cashews unsalted, 150g
* 4 tbsp nutritional yeast
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder

Add all ingredients to a food processor or ginder and mix until you have a parmesan like texture. Fill into a clean sealed jar and store in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 weeks.
