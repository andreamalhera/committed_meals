# Vegan goulash

* 125 g soy cubes or pea protein chunks
* 50 g oil (neutral frying oil, no olive oil)
* 50 g soy sauce
* 30 g vegan Worcester sauce (or 30 g more soy sauce)
* 15 g aceto balsamico (1 tbsp.)
* 15 g sugar (1 tbsp.)
* 125 g to 150 g onions finely diced (about 1 to 2)
* 1 large diced red bell pepper (approx. )
* 1 to 2 carrots in half moon slices
* 2 cloves of garlic finely diced
* 2 tbsp oil (neutral frying oil, not olive oil)
* 100 g tomato paste
* 40 g flour (approx. 3 tbsp, wheat flour 405, wheat flour 550 or spelt flour 630)
* 150 ml vegan red wine (150 ml)
* 1.5 tablespoons vegetable broth powder
* 1 tbsp vegan mustard
* 1 tsp of paprika rosenscharf
* 2 tsp of sweet paprika
* half a tsp of thyme
* half a tsp of marjoram
* salt and pepper


In a saucepan, bring 2 to 3 liters of water to a boil. Add 125 g dried soy cubes. 
Pot with boiling water and soy cubes. Boil for 12 minutes. Drain the soy cubes into a sieve or colander (strainer), rinse very well under running water (thorough rinsing will remove any soy flavor) and squeeze with your hands, a potato ricer or a cloth. Roughly dry the soy cubes so they can absorb the marinade well and not become flabby.

In a large bowl, combine 50 g oil, 50 g soy sauce. Mix 30 g Worcester sauce (or 30 g more soy sauce), 1 tbsp aceto balsamico (brown vinegar) = 15 g, 1 tbsp sugar = 15 g for the marinade. Add the soy cubes to the bowl with the marinade, mix well and cover. Allow to marinate for at least one hour.  You can also let the soy cubes marinate overnight in the refrigerator.
Instead of soy chunks you can use pea protein chunks, which are cooked faster or some smoked tofu for the easier faster version.

In a very large non-stick skillet (or roasting pan), heat 2 tablespoons oil, add marinated soy cubes and remaining marinade from bowl. Fry hot for 15 minutes without lid.
Add the onion, carrots and bell bell pepper and sauté on medium-high heat for 10 minutes. 
Then add 100 g of tomato paste and the pressed garlic and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. While stirring everything well and distribute. 
Sprinkle 40 g flour on top, stir in and sauté for 2 minutes. Keep stirring. 
Add red wine, 600 ml water, 1.5 tbsp vegetable broth powder and 1 tbsp mustard to the pan. 
Cover and bring to a boil. Then simmer for 30 minutes at low heat. Stir occasionally and add water to desired consistency. Add spices and season to taste with salt and pepper. 

Serve and enjoy!
