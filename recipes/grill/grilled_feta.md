# Grilled Feta
2 people, 25 min preparation time, grill and aluminium foil needed

* 1/3 hot pepper chopped finely
* spring onion
* 1 mint tip
* 100 g feta

Heat up the grill, alternatively preheat the oven to 180 °C circulating air or 200 °C top/bottom heat. Free the spring onion from roots and the top green and cut into fine rings. Crumble feta and put it on aluminum foil and sprinkle with the spring onions and the hot peppers. Then fold up the edges. Put the feta on the grill or alternatively cook it 15 min in the oven. Serve and garnish with mint tip. Enjoy!

#### Inspired by: 
* Based on "Orientalischer Kichererbsensalat mit Feta und gegrillter Nektarine" from Kochhaus, Munich

#### Note:
* Good as part of this [grilled salad](https://github.com/andreamalhera/committed_meals/edit/master/recipes/salads_and_appetizers/oriental_chickpeas_salad.md). For it, sepparate greens and whites, use the greens for the salad, and whites for the grilled feta. Also use 2/3 of the hot pepper for the salad.
