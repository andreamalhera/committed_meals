# Vegan Meatballs as Köttbullar

- ½ cup (100 g) dry lentils green or brown 
- 1 ½ cup (360 ml) water 
- 1 tbsp oil + more for brushing 
- 1 onion diced 4 garlic cloves minced 
- 1 cup (150 g) mushrooms roughly chopped 
- 2 tsp cumin 
- ¾ cup (70 g) rolled oats gluten-free if needed 
- 3 tbsp fresh parsley chopped (or sub 1 tbsp dried herbs) 
- 2-3 tbsp soy sauce or tamari sauce (if gluten-free) 
- ⅓ tsp salt or to taste 
- ½ tsp black pepper or to taste

Cook the lentils in a pot with 1 ½ cups of water for 20 minutes, or according to the package instructions. 
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a pan and sauté the onion for 3 minutes, until translucent. Add the garlic and sauté for another minute, until fragrant. Then add the chopped mushrooms and cumin and continue sautéing for about 3 minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender (*see step-by-step photos and recipe video above). 
Place the oats in a blender or food processor and process them into flour. Then add in the cooked lentils, sautéed onions, garlic, mushrooms, parsley, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Pulse until combined, but not puréed, leaving a little texture. Taste and adjust salt and pepper if needed. Then set the mixture aside for 10 minutes (or refrigerate overnight if you want to continue the next day).
Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. 
Form the mixture into balls with wet hands and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Brush or spray the balls with a little oil and bake for 25-30 minutes, turning them halfway through.
