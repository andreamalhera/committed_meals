# Frauke's Bread

* 500g (Whole grain) flour
* 150g (or more ğŸ™Š) seeds
* 500 ml water
* 1 Yeast cube or 14g yeast powder
* 2 tbsp fruit vinegar
* 1 tsp salt

Mix. Put in a mold. Bake in non-preheated oven set to 200Â°C for 45 min.

#### Inspired by: 
* Frauke A., who shared her great recipe with me 

#### Notes:
* A 500 g wheat bread bakes 40 minutes, a corresponding rye bread 45-50 minutes. Every 250 g more dough mass increases the baking time for wheat baked goods by 5 minutes and for rye baked goods by 10 minutes.
