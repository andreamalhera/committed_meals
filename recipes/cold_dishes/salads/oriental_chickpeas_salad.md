#### Inspired by: 
* Based on "Orientalischer Kichererbsensalat mit Feta und gegrillter Nektarine" from Kochhaus, Munich

#### Note:
* Goes very well with [Grilled Feta](https://github.com/andreamalhera/committed_meals/edit/master/recipes/grill/grilled_feta.md) on the side. For it, sepparate greens and whites, use the greens for the salad, and whites for the grilled feta. Also use 1/3 of the hot pepper for the grilled feta.
