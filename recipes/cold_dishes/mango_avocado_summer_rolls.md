Cut the mango into fine strips and if using dried mango soak them in a bowl with a some cold water. Halve the avocado, remove the core, remove the pulp and cut into about 0.5 cm wide slices. Squeeze lime juice into a small container. Free the pepper from the strunt, halve in length, remove the kernels and cut into fine strips. Wash the cucumber, remove the stalk, remove the ends,  cut accross in half and cut into fine sticks. Peel carrot, cut accross in half and cut into fine sticks as well. Put 6 hot pepper, cucumber and carrot sticks aside for decoration. If relevant, take the soaked mango out of the water. Put half of the peanuts in a bowl together with 2 tbsp. of lime juice, peanut butter and 5 tbsp. of warm water. Season with 1/2 tsp. sugar and 1/4 tsp. salt. In another bowl mix mango strips, coriander and 1 tbsp. of lime juice. Season with 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. sugar. Moisten a sheet of rice paper under running water for 10 seconds and spread it out on a moist surface.  Put some of the vegetable strips, avocado slices, peanuts and mango coriander mixture on the moist rice paper. Wrap rice paper from the left and right and place on top of the filling. Then also place the lower side on top of the filling.  Place a strip of pepperoni, carrot and cucumber in a slightly over the edge of the rolls. Then firmly roll up a roll. Do this individually with each rice paper and the filling, one after the other, so that 6 or 12 summer roles are created. Arrange the summer rolls on a plate with the seam facing down, and serve the peanut dip on the side and enjoy!

#### Inspired by: 
* Based on "Mango-Avocado-Sommerrollen mit Limette und Erdnuss-Dip" from Kochhaus, Munich

#### Note:
* Also good as salad. For the salad omit the rice paper replace with lettuce. Cut every ingredient in chunks instead of strips and add more water for the dip to be a dressing.
